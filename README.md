## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I've been working on ads solutions across [Fandom](https://www.fandom.com) sites and maintenance of [Rowerowy Poznań's](https://rowerowypoznan.pl) site,
- 🌱 Except the frontend related work I'm also interested in DDD and I've started DDD course from [domaindrivers.pl](https://www.domaindrivers.pl/) and [devstyle.pl](https://devstyle.pl),
- 🚲 Except coding I spent my free time looking at various transport related data and publish analyzes about bicycle traffic or road accidents on Rowerowy Poznań website,
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about ads, MediaWiki, Wordpress or using bicycle as transportation tool in Poznań 🐐 ❤️ 🐐
